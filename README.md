### Calendar To Do  
This project was originally made to help me organise at the uni. It allows you to create a task in a list, with the following properties :  
  

- A deadline (per defaut Monday)   
  

- A subject (per defaut CS)   
  

You can also cross it when you're done, so that the task moves to the other section.
